\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Charge carrier dynamics in an organic semiconductor can often be described in terms of charge hopping between localized states. The hopping rates depend on \slink{sec:transfer_integrals}{electronic coupling elements}, \slink{sec:reorganization}{reorganization energies}, and \slink{sec:site_energies}{site energies}, which vary as a function of position and orientation of the molecules. 
%The exact evaluation of these contributions in a molecular assembly is computationally prohibitive. Various, often semi-empirical, approximations are employed instead. 
The purpose of the \votcaxtp package~\cite{ruhle_microscopic_2011} is to simplify the workflow for charge transport simulations, provide a uniform error-control for the methods, flexible platform for their development, and eventually allow {\em in silico} prescreening of organic semiconductors for specific applications. 

The toolkit is implemented using modular concepts introduced earlier in the Versatile Object-oriented Toolkit for Coarse-graining Applications (VOTCA)~\cite{ruhle_versatile_2009}. It contains different \slink{sec:programs}{programs}, which execute specific tasks implemented in \slink{sec:calculators}{calculators} representing an individual step in the workflow. \Fig{summary} summarizes a typical chain of commands to perform a charge transport simulation:   
%
First, the VOTCA code structures are adap\-ted to reading atomistic trajectories, mapping them onto \slink{segments}{conjugated segments and rigid fragments}, and substituting (if needed) rigid fragments with the optimized copies (\xtpmap). The programs \xtprun and \xtpparallel (for heavy-duty tasks) are then used to calculate all bimolecular charge hopping rates (via precalculation of all required ingredients). \slink{sec:site_energies}{Site energies (or energetic disorder)} can be determined as a combination of internal (ionization potentials/electron affinities of single molecules) as well as electrostatic and polarization contributions within the molecular environment. The calculation of \slink{sec:transfer_integrals}{electronic coupling elements} between conjugated segments from the corresponding molecular orbitals can be performed using a \slink{sec:dipro}{dimer-projection} technique based on \slink{sec:dft}{density-functional} theory (DFT). This requires explicit calculations using quantum-chemistry software for which we provide interfaces to \gaussian, \turbomole, and \nwchem. Alternatively, the \slink{sec:izindo}{molecular orbital overlap} module calculates electronic coupling elements relying on the semi-empirical INDO Hamiltonian and molecular orbitals in the format provided by the \gaussian package. 

The  \slink{sec:kmc}{kinetic Monte Carlo} module reads in the \slink{neighborlist}{neighbor list}, \slink{morphology}{site coordinates}, and \slink{rates}{hopping rates} and performs charge dynamics simulations using either periodic boundary conditions or charge sources and sinks. 

The toolkit is written as a combination of modular C++ code and scripts. The data transfer between programs is implemented via a \slink{statefile}{state file} (sql database), which is also used to restart simulations. Analysis functions and most of the calculation routines are encapsulated by using the observer pattern~\cite{gamma_design_1995} which allows the implementation of new functions as individual modules.

In the following \sect{theory}, we summarize the \slink{sec:theory}{theoretical background} of the workflow of charge transport simulations and in particular its individual steps. \Sect{io} describes the structure and content of input and output files, while a full reference of \slink{sec:programs}{programs} and \slink{sec:calculators}{calculators} is available in \sect{reference}.
