	abstract = {Discotic mesophases are known for their ability to self-assemble into columnar structures which serve as semiconducting molecular wires. Charge-carrier mobility along these wires strongly depends on molecular packing which is controlled by intermolecular interactions. Using solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations we relate how conformations of alkyl and glycol side chains affect helical pitch and angular distribution of molecules within the columnar structures of perylenediimide derivatives. Using the high-temperature limit of Marcus theory we then establish a link between the secondary structure and charge-carrier mobility. Simulation results are compared to pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements. We conclude that for achieving high charge-carrier mobilities in discotics, side chains with specific interactions are required in order to minimize the translational and orientational molecular disorder in the columns.},

	abstract = {Partial disorder is an inherent property of self-assembled organic semiconductors that complicates their rational design, because electronic structure, self-assembling properties, and stability all have to be accounted for simultaneously. Therefore, the understanding of charge transport mechanisms in these systems is still in its infancy. A theoretical study of charge transport in organic semiconductors was performed on self-assembled layers of [1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene functionalized with alkyl side chains. Analysis showed that semiclassical dynamics misses static (on time scales of charge transport) disorder while the solution of the master equation combined with the high-temperature limit Marcus theory for charge transfer rates does not take into account molecular dynamic modes relaxing on a time scale of charge hopping. A comparison between predictions based on a perfectly ordered and a realistic crystal structure reveals the strong influence of static and dynamic disorder. The advantage of two-dimensional charge transporting materials over one-dimensional ones is clearly shown. The Marcus theory-based prediction of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 is in good agreement with our FET mobility of 0.22 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is an order of magnitude lower than that reported in the literature [Ebata, H.; et al.

	abstract = {Theoretical investigations of charge transport in organic materials are generally based on the energy splitting in dimer method and routinely assume that the transport parameters (site energies and transfer integrals) determined from monomer and dimer calculations can be reliably used to describe extended systems. Here, we demonstrate that this transferability can fail even in molecular crystals with weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions, due to the substantial (but often ignored) impact of polarization effects, particularly on the site energies. We show that the neglect of electronic polarization leads to qualitatively incorrect values and trends for the transfer integrals computed with the energy splitting method, even in simple prototypes such as ethylene or pentacene dimers. The polarization effect in these systems is largely electrostatic in nature and can change dramatically upon transition from a dimer to an extended system. For example, the difference in site energy for a prototypical face-to-edge one-dimensional stack of pentacene molecules is calculated to be 30\% greater than that in the face-to-edge dimer, whereas the site energy difference in the pentacene crystal is vanishingly small. Importantly, when computed directly in the framework of localized monomer orbitals, the transfer integral values for dimer and extended systems are very similar.},

The injection-barrier lowering due to the image potential is taken into account, so that the model provides a comprehensive treatment of the space-charge-limited current as well as the injection-limited current (ILC) regimes. We show that the current distribution can be highly filamentary for voltages, layer thicknesses, and disorder strengths that are realistic for organic light-emitting diodes and, that, as a result, the current density in both regimes can be significantly larger than as obtained from a one-dimensional continuum drift-diffusion device model. For devices with large injection barriers and strong disorder, in the ILC transport regime, good agreement is obtained with the average current density predicted from a model assuming injection and transport via one-dimensional filaments [A.

This effect destroys the translational symmetry of the electronic Hamiltonian and makes the band description inadequate for RT organic crystals. We used a one-dimensional semiclassical model to compute the (temperature dependent) charge carrier mobility in the presence of thermal fluctuations of the electronic Hamiltonian. This transport mechanism explains several contrasting experimental observations pointing sometimes to a delocalized "bandlike" transport and sometimes to the existence of strongly localized charge carriers.},

Comparison is given for results obtained with symmetrical and asymmetrical transition rates. It is shown that mesoscopic effects play an essential role even for rather long chains with hundreds of localization sites.

In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 ˚A apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 ˚A from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance.

Polarization is treated via self-consistent induced atomic dipoles. A modified version of Thole's interaction model is used to damp induction at short range. Repulsion?dispersion (vdW) effects are computed from a buffered 14?7 potential. In a departure from most current water potentials, we find that significant vdW parameters are necessary on hydrogen as well as oxygen. The new potential is fully flexible and has been tested versus a variety of experimental data and quantum calculations for small clusters, liquid water, and ice. Overall, excellent agreement with experimental and high level ab initio results is obtained for numerous properties, including cluster structures and energetics and bulk thermodynamic and structural measures. The parametrization scheme described here is easily extended to other molecular systems, and the resulting water potential should provide a useful explicit solvent model for organic solutes and biopolymer modeling.},

	abstract = {Charge carrier dynamics in an organic semiconductor can often be described in terms of charge hopping between localized states. The hopping rates depend on electronic coupling elements, reorganization energies, and driving forces, which vary as a function of position and orientation of the molecules. The exact evaluation of these contributions in a molecular assembly is computationally prohibitive. Various, often semiempirical, approximations are employed instead. In this work, we review some of these approaches and introduce a software toolkit which implements them. The purpose of the toolkit is to simplify the workflow for charge transport simulations, provide a uniform error control for the methods and a flexible platform for their development, and eventually allow in silico prescreening of organic semiconductors for specific applications. All implemented methods are illustrated by studying charge transport in amorphous films of tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum, a common organic semiconductor.
